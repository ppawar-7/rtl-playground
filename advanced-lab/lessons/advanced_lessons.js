        objective: 'Extract lower and upper nibbles from an 8-bit bus using bit slicing.',
        explanation: `In RTL digital design, multi-bit signals (buses) represent bundles of wires carrying binary vectors.
In Verilog, an 8-bit bus is declared as \`wire [7:0] data;\`.
Bit slicing syntax \`data[msb:lsb]\` allows extracting sub-vectors. For example, \`data[7:4]\` extracts the upper 4 bits (high nibble), and \`data[3:0]\` extracts the lower 4 bits (low nibble).
In ASIC physical design, bus routing must preserve bit ordering; swapping MSB and LSB leads to severe functional bugs.`,

In a Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA), the carry ripples from stage 0 to stage N-1. The worst-case delay is proportional to N (O(N) latency), making the carry chain the critical timing path in ASIC timing closure.`,

        explanation: `Carry (C) and Overflow (V) are fundamentally different:
- Carry (C): Set when unsigned addition exceeds 2^W - 1 (or subtraction requires a borrow).
- Overflow (V): Set when 2's complement signed addition of two numbers with the same sign produces a result with the opposite sign!
For 4-bit numbers (signed range -8 to +7):

        difficulty: 'Intermediate',
        category: 'Sequential',
        objective: 'Control register load and hold behavior using a clock enable signal.',
        explanation: `A multi-bit register stores binary state across clock cycles.
When Clock Enable (\`en\`) is high at a positive clock edge (\`posedge clk\`), the register samples data input \`d\` into output \`q\`.
When \`en\` is low, the register retains its previous value.
In ASIC physical design, clock gating cells (ICGs) are inserted automatically to disable the clock tree when \`en=0\`, saving massive dynamic power.`,

        explanation: `In synchronous design, reset (\`rst\`) is sampled only at the active clock edge.
When both \`rst\` and \`en\` are asserted simultaneously, RTL design convention dictates that reset takes priority:
\`if (rst) q <= 0; else if (en) q <= d;\`
This ensures deterministic circuit initialization.`,

Upon reaching M-1, the next clock edge wraps around to 0.

Because pure combinational logic has no memory, the compiler must infer a transparent latch (e.g. $dlatch).
